# Open-ended questions on GNNs

1. Have a look at this [solution](https://github.com/odinhg/Graph-Neural-Networks-INF367A) to a project from a previous class. The project description itself did not include a graph. Have a look at how different graphs can be incorporated into a machine learning problem. How does the underlying graph affect the results of GNNs? 

2. Many of you use graphs in your research. If you don't, collaborate with somebody who does. What is your learning problem on the graph? Read your graph into pytorch_geometric. Suggest a simple GNN architecture for your learning problem. Run a simple GNN on your data. 

3. Have a look at the [Topological Deep Learning Challenge](https://pyt-team.github.io/packs/challenge.html). If this is interesting to you, participate.
